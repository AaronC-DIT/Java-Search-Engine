Description:
	
The project I have chosen is the search engine tool, it takes a word to be searched from the user into a text field and has two features for searching, exact match and wildcard (If neither are selected, than wildcard is selected by default).

Exact match will match the word/string exactly.

Wildcard search will match any word/string that either matches exactly or contains the word within it.

The ‘Find’ button will then open up a file explorer. Rather than selecting one file, I have chosen to give the user the option to choose a directory instead. As a result the user may create a folder with all the files they wish to search for a specific string and select that folder, and as a result all the files will be searched.

If there are any matches, a dialog box with the names of the files will be shown to the user. If there is none, a simple error popup will be shown instead.
